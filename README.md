This project is an add-on for [Capsule](https://github.com/projectcapsule/capsule), the operator providing multi-tenancy in Kubernetes.

`capsule-proxy` allows to overcome the limitations of Kubernetes API Server on listing owned cluster-scoped resources, like Namespace, Ingress and Storage Classes, Nodes, and others covered by Capsule.
